# Systems

Systems \(technical systems\) can be registered by running an ABAP report.

To register on-premise systems, run the ABAP report program `/SDF/ALM_SETUP` as described in [Setup Steps in the SAP ABAP On-Premise System](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/setup-managed-services/setup-abap.html) on the SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal.

When the registration in the system has been completed, the registered system is automatically displayed on the *Systems* page. Once a technical system has been registered, a default logical system \(client\) is created and displayed in the *System Details*.

> ### Note:  
> If you want to create a logical system for two clients, run the ABAP report program from both clients.
