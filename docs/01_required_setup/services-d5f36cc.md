# Services

Depending on your subscribed service, there are different ways of importing or creating service information in the *Landscape Management* app.





### Automatic Import by SAP \(Preferred\)

For many subscribed services, related service information is imported automatically on a daily basis by the System Landscape Information service.

To display the current status in the *Landscape Management* app, open the *Configuration* \(:gear:\), expand the section *Import of Subscribed SAP Services*, and click on the first icon after *Status of imports*. If you don't want to wait for the daily import, you can import your services on demand in the *Status of Imports* popover by choosing *Import My Subscribed SAP Services*.

If your service hasn't been imported automatically, you may need to create the service information manually by following the steps described in the section *Manual Creation \(Only If Required\)*.

> ### Note:  
> **Additional information for global ultimate customers**:
> 
> As a global ultimate customer \(that is, a customer managing SAP cloud products that are subscribed under multiple customer accounts, for example after an acquisition\) you need to enter an S-user that has the authorizations to access the system data for all subsidiary customer accounts to ensure that the *Landscape Management* app has access to the data.
> 
> The S-user must not be a **technical** S-user but a standard **dialog** S-user with CCC Group authorizations. For more information on how to create such an S-user, refer to SAP Note [3070306](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3070306).
> 
> To add the S-user, open the *Landscape Management* app and choose <span style="font-size:16px;"><span class="SAP-icons">î‚¦</span></span> \(Configuration\). Under *Import of Subscribed SAP Services*, choose :heavy_plus_sign: and enter the credentials of the S-user.



### Automatic Creation by Service Registration

There are push-enabled services that register themselves in SAP Cloud ALM \(for example, SAP SuccessFactors and SAP S/4HANA Cloud\). These services are created automatically in the *Landscape Management* app as part of the communication arrangement or registration. If the services already exist in the app, the technical details are updated automatically.



### Manual Creation \(Only If Required\)

The automatic import by SAP is the preferred way to import service information for services. However, you can also manually add any additional services if necessary \(for example, services of the type `Unspecific Cloud Service (HTTP)` or SAP Ariba Cloud Integration Gateway\).

1.  Open the *Landscape Management* app.

2.  On the *Services* page, choose *Add*.

3.  Enter the following parameters:

    -   *Name*: Enter a name for the new service.

    -   *Description*: Optional, no entry required.

    -   *Tenant ID*: Enter the system number that is available in the [System Data](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/systemdata) application on SAP ONE Support Launchpad. The tenant ID is a unique identifier or alias for the tenant and is based on the tenant name.

    -   *Service Type*: Select the service type in the dropdown list.

    -   *Tenant Type*: Select the tenant type in the dropdown list.

    -   *Root URL*: Enter the URL that needs to be used to access the API.

    -   *External ID*: Optional, no entry required.

    -   *Customer Number*: Optional, no entry required.

    -   *Customer Name*: Optional, no entry required.


4.  Save the new service. You can now see it in the list.


After adding your service to the *Landscape Management* app, you need to establish a connection between the service and SAP Cloud ALM to collect monitoring data. How this connection is established depends on the individual service type. For detailed, service type-specific information on the managed services setup, refer to [Setup Managed Services / Systems](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/setup-managed-services.html) in the SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal.
