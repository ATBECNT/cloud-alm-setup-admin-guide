# Find User Data

In order to support users in their job, we store the following personal data in SAP Cloud ALM:

-   First and last name

-   Email address

-   User ID


A user with the administrator role can find all user data in the *User Management* app of SAP Cloud ALM.

Apart from this user record, personal data in SAP Cloud ALM exists in form of personalization configuration and in relation to application objects \(such as projects, tasks, and alerts\). These objects have their own lifetime and retention periods, independent of the users.
