# SAP Cloud Transport Management Service

By enabling the transport management for the SAP Cloud Transport Management service, you can orchestrate the deployment of transport requests through your implementation landscape.

To use the transport capabilities of SAP Cloud ALM in conjunction with the SAP Cloud Transport Management service, you have to establish a connection between SAP Cloud ALM and the SAP Cloud Transport Management service.

> ### Note:  
> SAP Cloud ALM currently only supports linear deployment routes modeled in the SAP Cloud Transport Management service.
> 
> Before you can use the deployment functionality in SAP Cloud ALM, you have to configure the nodes in the SAP Cloud Transport Management service.

## Procedure

After you've subscribed to the SAP Cloud Transport Management service, perform the following steps:

1.  **Set up the Product**

    Set up the specific use case according to the respective documentation, for example [Enabling Content Transport, Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/CLOUD_INTEGRATION/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/452c677debfc4fda904310560ab03743.html?version=Cloud).

2.  **Set up an SAP Cloud ALM API Instance**

    Set up the SAP Cloud ALM API instance and the Change and Deployment display and the scope management.

    To do this, perform the steps described in [Enabling SAP Cloud ALM API](enabling-sap-cloud-alm-api-704b5dc.md).

3.  **Set up HTTP Destinations and Transport Routes with SAP Cloud ALM Pass-Through**

    The product requires a destination to the SAP Cloud Transport Management service.

    The following steps apply only to the SAP Integration Suite. For other integrations, refer to the relevant documentation.

    In the SAP BTP subaccount where your source product tenant is hosted, create a destination targeted at the SAP Cloud Transport Management service.

    For how to set up the HTTP destination, refer to the following documentation [Creating HTTP Destinations and Transport Route](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/IAT/en-US/270f353a5b69472696617d91ceb58c93.html). Choose the blue *Cloud Transport Management* tab.

    In the URL section for the endpoint, enter the URL of your SAP Cloud ALM API instance that follows a pattern like this: ***https://eu10.alm.cloud.sap/api/imp-cdm-transport-management-api/v1***. The first part of the URL until `/api` depends on your company account and is variable.
