# Enabling Service Delivery

The *Service Delivery Center* in SAP Cloud ALM is a collaborative application. SAP exchanges service-related information with your SAP Cloud ALM account, such as:

-   SAP pushes relevant service orders and service results to your SAP Cloud ALM tenant.

-   SAP and your SAP Cloud ALM tenant exchange preparation tasks, issues, and actions that are created for your services.

-   You can upload service-related documents and access uploaded documents for your service. Documents are stored centrally within the SAP space.


To be able to use the service delivery applications, you need to give you consent to this data exchange.

When you open the *Service Delivery Center* application, you're prompted with a dialog that asks for your confirmation.
