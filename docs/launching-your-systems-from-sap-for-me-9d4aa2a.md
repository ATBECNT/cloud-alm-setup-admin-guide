# Launching Your Systems from SAP for Me

The *Systems & Provisioning* dashboard on SAP for Me is your one-stop place for all your active public cloud systems on SAP BTP.

From here, you can navigate to your global account on SAP BTP and to your SAP Cloud ALM tenant:

1.  To find your system information for SAP Cloud ALM, open the [Systems](https://me.sap.com/systemsprovisioning/systems) page on SAP for Me.

2.  Under *Public Cloud Systems on BTP*, filter by cloud service *SAP Cloud ALM*. This lists two entries for SAP Cloud ALM:

    -   Data Center Region: Global

    -   Data Center Region: <Region of the subaccount\>


    > ### Note:  
    > If your company has multiple customer numbers, the entries related to SAP Cloud ALM may occur for several of these customer numbers. Each customer number can have its own SAP Cloud ALM installation.

3.  Launch the respective systems as follows:

    -   To launch SAP Cloud ALM, click on the system number of the entry with the data center region <Region of the subaccount\>. Then choose *Launch System*.

    -   To launch your global account on SAP BTP, click on the GUID in the *Global Account* column. Then choose *Launch System*.
