SAP Cloud ALM is included in cloud subscriptions with SAP Enterprise Support. Sufficient resources for standard use are included per default:

You can subscribe to additional services, to cover extended use scenarios.

## Memory Extension

Additional memory usage, beyond the standard, requires the subscription of the microservice *SAP Cloud ALM, memory extension*. This service is available in blocks of 4 GB, with a fix price per month.

The following requirements can cause an extended SAP Cloud ALM usage, above the average usage:

-   Building own UIs or dashboards

-   Programming own enhancements

-   Extensive storing of data from monitoring activities on the SAP HANA database

-   Storing large amounts of monitoring data for a large system landscape for a longer time period \(performance, business process monitoring or integration monitoring\)

-   Using additional monitoring platforms outside the SAP landscape and is uploading monitoring data daily from a third-party system.

-   Uploading many large files as attachments to documents.


You can subscribe to the service if you're using SAP Cloud ALM. It's available via a service subscription on CPEA: see [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/serviceCatalog/sap-cloud-alm-memory-extension).

SAP also actively approaches you if your memory usage is beyond the baseline memory \(see also the [SAP usage rights](https://support.sap.com/usage-rights)\):

-   The activation of the memory extension service is required after SAP has reviewed and excluded own technical reasons.

-   You're informed when the overusage has been recognized and requested to start a CPEA agreement during the next month and activate the service *SAP Cloud ALM, memory extension*.

-   If you continue to extend the 8-GB memory over the next months, without an extension, SAP reserves the right to take legal action.


Charging of costs:

-   When the service is activated, you're automatically charged for every month where you extend the memory at least once.

-   In months without a memory consumption beyond 8 GB, there's no charging.

-   Metering starts at first day of the month and rests on the latest day of the month.

-   The service is available in packages of 4-GB memory. If, for example, you need an extra of 6 GB in a month, you're charged for 2 packages.
